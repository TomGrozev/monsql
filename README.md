The premise was to create an easier way to interact with MySQL using NodeJS.

I wrote this code a while back as a quick and dirty way to simplify some processes for me. This by no means is something that should be used in a production environment as it has not been extensively tested.
My need for this project is no longer, hence I have not revisted it and as I have moved away from SQL databases (for the most part) I am unlikely to revisit it.
